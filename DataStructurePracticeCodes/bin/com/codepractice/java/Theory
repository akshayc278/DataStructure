Data Structure type->  linear , non linear
linear -> array ,linked list, stack, queue
non linear-> (multilevel difficult to implement and traverse) tree ,graph

Algorithm -> set of instruction to solve task
eg:- recipe book having step by step instruction

Analysis of algorithm:- deals with finding best algorithm which solves problem
Best case :  Omega -^- best 
Worst case : Big O
Average : Theta (-)
